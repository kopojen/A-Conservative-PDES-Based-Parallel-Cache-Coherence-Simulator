# Dataset
---
This is a real trace dataset obtained by running PARSEC on USIMM.
The dataset is released along with the source code on [USIMM](https://utaharch.blogspot.com/2012/02/usimm.html).

We use `count_to_timestamp.py` to transform the strucutre of the data into what we need, i.e., timestamp of each instruction.

The dataset is zipped into 4 files, use `unzip-all.sh` to inflate them.
